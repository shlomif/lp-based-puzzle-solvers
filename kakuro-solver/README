One is given a rectangular grid of squares, with clues indicating
For each row, there is a clue (sometimes optional) which specifies the sum of
the labels of the columns of the selected squares in that row.
Likewise each column contains a clue below it that specifies the sum of the
labels of the rows of selected squares.

The "kakuraso-solver.py" Python program can be used to solve Kakurasu layouts.
It accepts as an argument a layout description of the following format:

<<<
$WIDTH*$HEIGHT
$ROW_CLUE[1]
$ROW_CLUE[2]
$ROW_CLUE[3]
.
.
$ROW_CLUE[$HEIGHT]
Vert: $COL_CLUE[1] $COL_CLUE[2] $COL_CLUE[3] ... $COL_CLUE[$WIDTH]
>>>

$ROW_CLUE[$idx] and $COL_CLUE[$idx] are either positive integers or '?' (for 
no clue)

Example Kakurasu layouts can be found in the layouts sub-dir.
